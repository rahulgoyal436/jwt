FUNCTION_DEF=func isEs() bool 
Scenario 1: Normal operation with an algorithm that starts with "ES"

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the function when the provided algorithm string starts with "ES". It verifies that the function correctly identifies such strings and returns true.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the flagAlg variable to a string that starts with "ES".
Act: Invoke the isEs function.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation: 
The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an algorithm string that starts with "ES". This test is important because it verifies the correct operation of the function under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Normal operation with an algorithm that does not start with "ES"

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the function when the provided algorithm string does not start with "ES". It verifies that the function correctly identifies such strings and returns false.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the flagAlg variable to a string that does not start with "ES".
Act: Invoke the isEs function.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation: 
The assertion checks that the function correctly identifies an algorithm string that does not start with "ES". This test is important because it verifies the correct operation of the function under normal conditions.

Scenario 3: Edge case with an empty algorithm string

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the function when the provided algorithm string is empty. It verifies that the function correctly handles such cases and returns false.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the flagAlg variable to an empty string.
Act: Invoke the isEs function.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation: 
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles an empty algorithm string. This test is important because it verifies the operation of the function under edge-case conditions.

Scenario 4: Edge case with a nil algorithm string

Details:
Description: This test is meant to check the operation of the function when the provided algorithm string is nil. It verifies that the function correctly handles such cases and returns false.
Execution:
Arrange: Set the flagAlg variable to nil.
Act: Invoke the isEs function.
Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation: 
The assertion checks that the function correctly handles a nil algorithm string. This test is important because it verifies the operation of the function under edge-case conditions.
