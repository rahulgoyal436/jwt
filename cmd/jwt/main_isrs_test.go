FUNCTION_DEF=func isRs() bool 
Scenario 1: Algorithm Prefix is "RS"
  
  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an algorithm with the "RS" prefix.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of flagAlg to a string starting with "RS".
    Act: Invoke the isRs function.
    Assert: Check that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks for a true return value, which is expected because the flagAlg begins with "RS". This behavior is important to ensure that the function correctly recognizes RSA algorithms.
  
Scenario 2: Algorithm Prefix is "PS"

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly identifies an algorithm with the "PS" prefix.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of flagAlg to a string starting with "PS".
    Act: Invoke the isRs function.
    Assert: Check that the function returns true.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks for a true return value, which is expected because the flagAlg begins with "PS". This behavior is important to ensure that the function correctly recognizes PS algorithms.
    
Scenario 3: Algorithm Prefix is neither "RS" nor "PS"

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an algorithm that does not start with "RS" or "PS".
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of flagAlg to a string that does not start with "RS" or "PS".
    Act: Invoke the isRs function.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks for a false return value, which is expected because the flagAlg does not begin with "RS" or "PS". This behavior is important to ensure that the function correctly returns false for non-RSA/PS algorithms.
    
Scenario 4: Algorithm Prefix is empty

  Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly handles an empty algorithm prefix.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the value of flagAlg to an empty string.
    Act: Invoke the isRs function.
    Assert: Check that the function returns false.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks for a false return value, which is expected because the flagAlg is empty. This behavior is important to ensure that the function correctly handles empty input.
