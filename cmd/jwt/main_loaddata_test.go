FUNCTION_DEF=func loadData(p string) ([]byte, error) 
Scenario 1: Load data from a specified file path

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can successfully load data from a specified file path.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create a test file with some dummy data.
    Act: Invoke the loadData function with the path to the test file.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned data matches the contents of the test file.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function can successfully read data from a file. This is important for the application's ability to load data from files.

Scenario 2: Load data from standard input

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function can successfully load data from standard input.
Execution:
    Arrange: Mock standard input to provide some dummy data.
    Act: Invoke the loadData function with "-" as the argument.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned data matches the mocked standard input data.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function can successfully read data from standard input. This is important for the application's ability to load data from different sources.

Scenario 3: Return empty JSON object when path is "+"

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function returns an empty JSON object when the path is "+".
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the loadData function with "+" as the argument.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned data is an empty JSON object.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function behaves as expected when given "+" as the argument. This is important for the function's ability to handle special cases.

Scenario 4: Return error when no path is specified

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function returns an error when no path is specified.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the loadData function with an empty string as the argument.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function behaves as expected when given an empty string as the argument. This is important for the function's ability to handle invalid arguments.

Scenario 5: Return error when file does not exist

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function returns an error when the specified file does not exist.
Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required for this test.
    Act: Invoke the loadData function with a non-existent file path as the argument.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns an error.
Validation:
    The assertion checks if the function behaves as expected when given a non-existent file path as the argument. This is important for the function's ability to handle errors during file operations.
