FUNCTION_DEF=func isNone() bool 
Scenario 1: FlagAlg is set to "none"

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns true when the flagAlg is set to "none". This is the normal operation of the function.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set flagAlg to "none".
    Act: Invoke the isNone function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns true.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking that the function correctly identifies when the flagAlg is set to "none". This is the expected behavior of the function, and it's crucial for the application's ability to correctly process flags.

Scenario 2: FlagAlg is set to a value other than "none"

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns false when the flagAlg is set to a value other than "none". This is an edge case of the function's operation.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set flagAlg to a value other than "none".
    Act: Invoke the isNone function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking that the function correctly identifies when the flagAlg is not set to "none". This is an important test to ensure that the function doesn't incorrectly identify non-"none" values as "none".

Scenario 3: FlagAlg is not set

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns false when the flagAlg is not set. This is another edge case of the function's operation.
Execution:
    Arrange: Do not set a value for flagAlg.
    Act: Invoke the isNone function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the function returns false.
Validation:
    The assertion is checking that the function correctly identifies when the flagAlg is not set. This is crucial for the application's ability to handle situations where the flagAlg hasn't been defined.
