FUNCTION_DEF=func printJSON(j interface) error 
Scenario 1: Successful JSON Marshalling with Compact Flag Off

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function can successfully marshal a given interface into JSON format with indents when the compact flag is turned off (default setting).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a map or struct instance to provide as input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the printJSON function with the created map or struct instance.
  Assert: Check if the output JSON string is correctly formatted with indents and no error is returned.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when the compact flag is off. The function is expected to print out a JSON string with indents. The test is important as it verifies the function's ability to correctly marshal an interface and format the output JSON string.

Scenario 2: Successful JSON Marshalling with Compact Flag On

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function can successfully marshal a given interface into compact JSON format when the compact flag is turned on.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the compact flag to true and create a map or struct instance to provide as input to the function.
  Act: Invoke the printJSON function with the created map or struct instance.
  Assert: Check if the output JSON string is correctly formatted without indents and no error is returned.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when the compact flag is on. The function is expected to print out a compact JSON string without indents. The test is important as it verifies the function's ability to correctly marshal an interface and format the output JSON string based on the compact flag.

Scenario 3: Unsuccessful JSON Marshalling due to Invalid Input

Details:
  Description: This test is meant to check if the function correctly returns an error when given an invalid interface that cannot be marshaled into JSON.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an invalid interface instance that cannot be marshaled into JSON.
  Act: Invoke the printJSON function with the created invalid interface instance.
  Assert: Check if an error is returned.
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function when provided with an invalid interface. The function is expected to return an error. The test is important as it verifies the function's ability to handle errors and invalid inputs.
