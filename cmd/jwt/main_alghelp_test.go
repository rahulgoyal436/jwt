FUNCTION_DEF=func algHelp() string 
Scenario 1: Normal Operation of the algHelp Function

Details:
    Description: This test is meant to check the normal operation of the algHelp function. It should return the algorithm identifiers in a sorted and formatted string.
Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is required as the function does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the algHelp function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string contains the expected algorithm identifiers, sorted and formatted correctly.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function. The expected result is a sorted and formatted string of algorithm identifiers. This test is crucial to ensure that the function is correctly retrieving and formatting the algorithm identifiers.

Scenario 2: Testing the Formatting of the algHelp Function

Details:
    Description: This test is designed to check the formatting of the algHelp function. The function should insert a comma and a newline after every 7th algorithm identifier.
Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is required as the function does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the algHelp function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string inserts a comma and a newline after every 7th algorithm identifier.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function. The expected result is a string that correctly formats the algorithm identifiers with a comma and a newline after every 7th identifier. This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly formatting the algorithm identifiers.

Scenario 3: Testing the Sorting of the algHelp Function

Details:
    Description: This test is designed to check the sorting of the algHelp function. The function should return the algorithm identifiers in sorted order.
Execution:
    Arrange: No special arrangement is required as the function does not take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the algHelp function.
    Assert: Use Go testing facilities to verify that the returned string contains the algorithm identifiers in sorted order.
Validation:
    The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the function. The expected result is a string that correctly sorts the algorithm identifiers. This test is important to ensure that the function is correctly sorting the algorithm identifiers.

Note: The actual implementation of these tests would require a list of the expected algorithm identifiers to compare against the output of the function. This list is not provided here, so these scenarios are hypothetical and would need to be adjusted based on the actual algorithms available.
